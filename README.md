Bitbrowze is an ERC721 smartcontract.
The smartcontract has an Oracle feature to monitor trigger-events such as internet time and weather in order to fulfill agreements.
A new user registers at Bitbrowze.com/login  and is enabled to upload an image from his computer or a URL
He is redirected to the Wordpress sites (Crozdale.com  or  Xdale.io)
where the uploaded image has been replicated in his my-account "Shop" Window
He can then purchase permission to Mint it as an NFT after checking out and returning to click "Order History".
The minted NFT automatically uploads to his Shop window and simultaneously to Opensea.io/crozdale for additional reach where it can be viewed, sold or Auctioned.
